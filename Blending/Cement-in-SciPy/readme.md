# Cement blending in SciPy

## Summary
Description: Implements a real cement blending optimization problem from a 1977 cement and concrete research paper.

Category: Blending.

Type: LP.

Library: SciPy.

Solver: SLSQP.

## Notes

The model has been modified to run as a Jupyter Notebook.

We have also created a refactored version that emphasises the matrix nature of writing LP models using SciPy.
