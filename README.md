# Collated optimization models
In this repository we have collated optimization models from numerous sources.

The models are grouped into categories, representing the type of problem, including:
- Bin packing and cutting.
- Facility location.
- Fantasy sports.
- Non-linear functions.
- Scheduling.
- Shortest path.

In some cases we have edited the source to make it run in a Jupyter Notebook, to augment the example with notes, and/or add features to the original code.

Note that we apply the GPL-3.0 license to our content. The original sources may apply different licenses, so please check with the original sources.
