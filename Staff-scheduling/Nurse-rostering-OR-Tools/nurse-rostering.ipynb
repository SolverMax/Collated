    "This is a simple nurse rostering model using a DFA and AddAutomaton. The DFA is from MiniZinc Tutorial, Nurse Rostering example:\n",
    "- one day off every 4 days\n",
    "- no 3 nights in a row.\n",
    "\n",
    "See https://www.minizinc.org/tutorial/minizinc-tute.pdf section 4.1.4 \"Regular\" for details.\n",

    "Compare with nurse_rostering_sat.py which use my slower decomposition the MiniZinc style regular constraint.\n",
