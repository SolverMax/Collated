# Staff scheduling
Find an optimal way to assign people to shifts, allowing for constraints such as:
- A person must work only one shift per day.
- Non-availability must be allowed for.
- Preferences should be considered.
- Specific types of staff may be required in each shift.

This type of model can be applied to constrained scheduling problems in other fields.

A special case, often used to represent the whole category, is called the Nurse Scheduling Problem or the Nurse Rostering Problem: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse_scheduling_problem
