# Nurse scheduling
Find an optimal way to assign nurses to shifts, allowing for constraints such as:
- A nurse must work only one shift per day.
- Non-availability must be allowed for.
- Preferences should be considered.
- Specific types of nurses may be required in each shift.

This type of model can be applied to constrained scheduling problems in other fields.
